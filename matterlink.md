# MatterLink

This mod makes chat got crossplatform and cross protocol, like really across all the platforms

By connecting to a exsiting cross protocol bridge (matterbridge) this this mod provides some benifits:

- support many chat protocols
  Discord, IRC, Slack, MatterChat, XMPP, telegram
- Will not take your chatbridge down on server crash / restart (except for the minecraft part)
- No performance cost from having to deal with many connections to different APIs from the server

MatterLink also adds customizable commands to chat

try

- !list
- !uptime
- !tps
- !version
